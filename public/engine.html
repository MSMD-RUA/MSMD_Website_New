  <h1>The Engine</h1>
  <p>The MSMD / Ngā Wai o Rua engine is a closed-loop system: feeling → choice → action → reflection → law. It lives across carving benches, cameras, code, ledgers, and this website.</p>
  <p>This page exists so search engines and people both have a clear doorway into understanding what “the engine” means in this context.</p>
