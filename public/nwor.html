  <h1>Ngā Wai o Rua (NWOR)</h1>
  <p>Ngā Wai o Rua is the two-water flow of this kaupapa — the crossing between physical world (stone, wood, steel) and digital world (pixels, code, timelines).</p>
  <p>NWOR tracks how a single action can ripple through both streams, turning practice into pattern and pattern into law.</p>
