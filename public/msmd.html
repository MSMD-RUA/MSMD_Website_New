  <h1>Moko See Moko Do (MSMD)</h1>
  <p>Moko See Moko Do is the core engine of this kaupapa — a living whare where whakairo, digital motion, and law are braided together. Doing &gt; talking. Every cut is a decision; every chip is evidence.</p>
  <p>This site shows the engine breathing in real time through Gates, Walls, Whiro ledger entries, and Rongo reflections.</p>
